FR-02S0101|Yosuke|There's no way the police can do it... Who'd believe that the murderer kills people by throwing them into the TV?
FR-02S0201|Yosuke|Sorry about that. You know me, I'm infamous around here.
FR-02S0301|Yosuke|Wait a minute... Am I starting to sound like Teddie?
FR-02S0302|Yosuke|Looks like someone got my address. I get a lot of spam.
FR-02S0401|Yosuke|Phew I'm beat... I am not the complaints department...
FR-02S0402|Yosuke|I have to do what I can...
FR-02S0501|Yosuke|So...? You keep the goods under your futon?
FR-02S0502|Yosuke|So, you ever invited a girl in here?
FR-02S0601|Yosuke|But hey, I'm glad you were there! Thanks.
FR-02S0602|Yosuke|So... there's no need to bother with outsiders.
FR-02S0701||They started to badmouth Saki-senpai
FR-02S0702|Yosuke|I just blurted out a buncha crap, huh?
FR-02S0801|Yosuke|But then...
FR-02S0802|Yosuke|I'm sorry... Saki-senpai. I'm sorry... Main Character.
FR-02S0803|Yosuke|Main Character... I think I'm all cried out...
FR-02S0901||Yosuke is smiling sadly...
FR-02S0902|Yosuke|Just being born, living your life... Before you know it, you're already special to someone.
FR-02S1001|Yosuke|I like you for that, and I'm proud of you... But I guess I was jealous at the same time.
FR-02S1002||Will hitting Yousuke make you and him equal...?
FR-03S0101|Yukiko|Do you think the culprit will come... ?
FR-03S0102||You haven't yet asked Yukiko for her contact information.
FR-03S0201|Yukiko|Sensei recommended this book to me because it has details on a bunch of different job licenses...
FR-03S0202|Yukiko|I was thinking something along the lines of an interior decorator... What do you think?
FR-03S0301|Yukiko|Even eggs come in so many varieties...
FR-03S0302|Yukiko|So I'm going to get some practice while I can!
FR-03S0303|Yukiko|W-will... you?
FR-03S0401||For some reason, an unusually pungent smell hangs in the air.
FR-03S0402||Yukiko looks sad...
FR-03S0403|Yukiko|Umm... I'm sorry to drag you around...
FR-03S0501|Yukiko|Then the furniture department. I want to look at the desk. Those and the lamps...
FR-03S0502|Yukiko|Those people are from some TV station. They wanted to cover the Amagi Inn.
FR-03S0503|Yukiko|...I'd feel better about leaving.
FR-03S0601|Yukiko|I wrote down everything I need, so this shouldn't take that long.
FR-03S0602|Yukiko|But it's not turning out quite like it does in the book, even though I'm following the directions.
FR-03S0603|Yukiko|Are they that worried about my cooking...?
FR-03S0701|Yukiko|Once I leave this town... I won't be able to come here again, will I...?
FR-03S0702|Yukiko|They all have the wrong idea... I'm really sorry...
FR-03S0801|Yukiko|I'm sorry, I have to go.
FR-03S0802|Yukiko|W-was I scary?
FR-03S0901|Yukiko|Are you going to wish for something, Main Character-kun?
FR-03S0902|Yukiko|I-is it okay... for me to ask...?
LV-03S1001|Yukiko|Umm, sorry... I don't know what to talk about...
LV-03S1002|Yukiko|That's why... I'm going to stay here. By my own will.
LV-03S1003|Yukiko|It's a charm from that shrine... To protect you.
FR-03S1001|Yukiko|That's why... I'm going to stay here. By my own will.
FR-03S1002|Yukiko|It's the charm from that shrine... to protect you.
FR-05S0101|Kanji|Oh, you here to tell me off or somethin'?
FR-05S0102|Kanji|Senpai, you suspecting me!?
FR-05S0103|Kanji|At this rate, I'll be causing trouble for you guys...
FR-05S0201|Kanji|She's always apologizing for me. She's been sprouting more and more white hairs...
FR-05S0301|Kanji|... ...
FR-05S0302|Kanji|Sorry. Looks like it was no big deal...
FR-05S0303|Kanji’s Mother|He's always had trouble getting along with people. He didn't have any friends like you before.
FR-05S0401|Kanji|Ughh... When you met Ma at the Hospital... She say anything about me?
FR-05S0402|Kanji|Oh, uhh... I'm gonna go now.
FR-05S0403|Kanji|Oh... Anyways, sorry 'bout dragging you into this...
FR-05S0501|Kanji|Er... 
FR-05S0502|Kanji|Hah, he said I'm cool...
FR-05S0601|Kanji|Strange situation I got myself into, ain't it?
FR-05S0701|Kanji|That okay with you 'big bro'?
FR-05S0702|Kanji|There's something else I gotta confront too, ain't there?
FR-05S0801|Police Officer|… Come with me.
FR-05S0802|Police Officer|Hmph, so you admit it. Not a shred of remorse, either.
FR-05S0803|Police Officer|What a load of... There's no way you're getting me to believe that.
FR-05S0901|Kanji|Its the first time I went on my own... Well, I had a lot to tell him.
FR-05S0902|Kanji|As long as there's someone like that snot-nosed kid to accept me, I ain't afraid of nothing!
FR-06S0101|Dojima|Uhhh... Well, how's school?
FR-06S0102|Dojima|You know what I'm talking about, right?
FR-06S0201|Dojima|So... What have you been doing after school?
FR-06S0202|Dojima|But its not as if we have much in common... except for the murders.
FR-06S0203|Dojima|You're more like a very young brother to me than a son.
FR-06S0301|Dojima|'When is always,' huh...?
FR-06S0302|Dojima|Plus... I'm not fit to be her family.
FR-06S0401|Dojima|All we've got is instant, though. How do you take it?
FR-06S0402|Dojima|Go watch TV with Nanako. I'll bring it to you when it's ready.
FR-06S0501|Dojima|Oh... Sorry, I wasn't talking about you.
FR-06S0502|Dojima|It's late. Go to sleep.
FR-06S0601|Dojima|Let's stop there.
FR-06S0602|Dojima|I don't need a private life to do that. ...Nanako will understand.
FR-06S0701|Dojima|I can do that anytime.
FR-06S0801|Dojima|Sorry, but my hands are full here.
FR-06S0802|Dojima|Do you understand why?
FR-06S0901|Dojima|Er... Sorry about making you go along with this.
FR-06S0902|Dojima|That's why I used revenge as an excuse to spend time away from her...
FR-06S1001|Dojima|This is your personal mug. Write your name on it later.
FR-06S1002|Dojima|Main Character, take care of Nanako.
FR-07S0101|Rise|... ...
FR-07S0201|Rise|But it's a little embarrassing to show up alone, you know?
FR-07S0301|Rise|It'll take time to get back, so let's walk around quick!
FR-07S0401||Rise is worried...
FR-07S0402||Rise looks desperate...
FR-07S0403|Rise|I'm sorry... Lying about marrying you and all...
FR-07S0501|Rise|Senpai, have you ever thought that you're pushing yourself too far, or that you were just acting...?
FR-07S0502|Rise|You're with me right now because I am Risette, yeah?
FR-07S0601|Inoue|A fan letter came, you see...
FR-07S0602|Rise|To think I trusted him... I feel betrayed!
FR-07S0603|Rise|I gave up on being Risette. I can't meet her expectations...
FR-07S0604|Rise|Doesn't that sound fun? H-how about it? Haha... Ha...
FR-07S0701|Rise|... She was cute, so I figured she would sell.
FR-07S0702|Rise|You like having such a cuter underclassman, right? I'm an ex-idol, after all.
FR-07S0703||Rise looks helpless...
FR-07S0801|Rise|Senpai... I... I don't know why I'm crying...
FR-07S0802||...You sense this is an important moment. There's no turning back.
FR-07S0901|Rise|And yet... I felt so angry about it... Why do you think that is?
LV-07S1001|Rise|I'll ask the man himself! So—where do you hide them!?
FR-08S0101|Chie|Oh, mornin'.
FR-08S0102|Chie|I dunno, I guess that's what draws people to you, or something like that.
FR-08S0103||You haven't yet asked Chie for her contact information.
FR-08S0201|Chie|Still, now's the time to train right?
FR-08S0202|Chie|...No?
FR-08S0301|Chie|But me, I totally lose it... Kinda funny, huh?
FR-08S0401|Chie|W-well...
FR-08S0402||What should you do?
FR-08S0501|Chie|Mmm... The meat and rice just flow through my veins...
FR-08S0502|Chie|I hope she's not straining herself. Makes you worry, huh?
FR-08S0601|Chie|What cowards, ganging up on the weak like that!
FR-08S0602|Chie|We'll grab 'em and make them apologize! Right, leader?
FR-08S0701||Things aren't looking good...
FR-08S0702|Chie|I charged in by myself... Caused you trouble...
FR-08S0801|Chie|I feel like I missed the point...
FR-08S0901||Things aren't looking good...
FR-08S0902|Chie|...Was that stupid of me?
FR-08S0903|Chie|What to do?
LV-08S1001|Chie|Oh w-well, how did the room you had back home look?
LV-08S1002|Chie| I was thinking... maybe both of us together...
LV-08S1003||What should you do?
LV-08S1004|Chie|Wh-what am I saying...?
FR-08S1001|Chie|We are always teammates... That's it!
FR-09S0101|Nanako|U-um...
FR-09S0201||Nanako is fidgeting.
FR-09S0202|Nanako|Are you an only child?
FR-09S0203|Nanako|Hmm… Then do you have a little sister?
FR-09S0301|Nanako|Dad'll be disappointed.
FR-09S0302|Nanako|Nanako looks sad.
FR-09S0401|Nanako|Nanako is nodding her head cheerfully.
FR-09S0402|Nanako|What happens to a person when they die?
FR-09S0403|Nanako|Why do bad people do bad things?
FR-09S0404|Nanako|Are bad people more important to Dad than I am?
FR-09S0501|Nanako|What do they mean by 'real'?
FR-09S0502|Nanako|Daddy doesn't come home because I'm not his 'real' daughter?
FR-09S0503||What should you do...?
FR-09S0601||Nanako looks like she's about to cry...
FR-09S0602|Nanako|He can't come, huh?
FR-09S0701|Dojima|What's gotten into her...?
FR-09S0702|Dojima|She'll listen to you...
FR-09S0703|Nanako|Big bro...
FR-09S0704|Nanako|Is he going to throw me away, too...?
FR-09S0801|Nanako|What should I do...? The teacher is will yell at me.
FR-09S0802|Nanako|Why did Dad stop smiling...?
FR-09S0901|Nanako|Big bro... I love my Dad.
FR-09S0902|Nanako|…I feel sorry for him, losing someone he loves.
FR-09S0903||What would you do...?
FR-09S1001|Nanako|Big bro, can you make me a salad?
FR-09S1002|Nanako|You're my family, too, so... Let's work hard together!
FR-11S0101|Naoto|What sort of person gave this to you?
FR-11S0102|Naoto|The man is most likely still here in Inaba. I cannot drag you further into this.
FR-11S0201|Naoto|I'd chalk it up as a prank.
FR-11S0202|Naoto|... ...
FR-11S0203|Naoto|I don't know about those, but my belongings aren't of any particular value, so...
FR-11S0301||Naoto is holding a sealed letter...
FR-11S0302|Naoto|How misleading... a sealed letter at a time like this...
FR-11S0401||Naoto is holding a card.
FR-11S0402|Naoto|I haven't the time to waste on this...
FR-11S0403|Naoto|But... to ignore it only makes me angry!
FR-11S0501|Naoto|*sigh* What should I do...?
FR-11S0502|Naoto|'Eating letters with a red face'...? This is...
FR-11S0503|Naoto|Grampa had this? Why did he keep it...?
FR-11S0504|Naoto|I, er... I think I'll let this play out... And, umm, if possible...
FR-11S0601|Naoto|Why you, though...?
FR-11S0602|Naoto|When the bank close, the fruit tree grows. By the large seven at at the third is the spot I chose...
FR-11S0603|Naoto|... ...
FR-11S0701|Naoto|Perhaps the 'minus' part is important...
FR-11S0702|Naoto|I feel that... I'm undergoing a change.
FR-11S0801|Naoto|We may be able to catch him in the act.
FR-11S0802||The man brandished a knife.
FR-11S0803|Naoto|Why...!?
FR-11S0901|Naoto|A place I'd be fond of...?
FR-11S0902|Naoto|Next, what I 'can't stand' to do. There are several possibilities, but...
LV-11S1001|Naoto|Judging by the position of your TV, you regularly watch the Midnight Channel from...
LV-11S1002|Naoto|D-do you find the pitch of my voice strange?
FR-11S1001|Naoto|What about you?
FR-11S1002|Naoto|Now you're my assistant!
FR-12S0101|P.E. Teacher|Here, why don't you say something to the team?
FR-12S0102|Kou|...You've played before, right?
FR-12S0103|Daisuke|I’ll help you. Let’s get this done and get outta here.
FR-12S0201|Kou|Hey Main Character, Aiya or Junes? You decide.
FR-12S0202|Kou|Well, I do like me some sweets...
FR-12S0203|Kou|You like sweets, Main Character? Want me to get you some, too?
FR-12S0301|Daisuke|...I want you to help him out.
FR-12S0302|Daisuke|She calls it 'barbaric'
FR-12S0303|Daisuke|So... I want you to help him out.
FR-12S0401|Kou|Just the other day I was greeting people at one of those high society gatherings. Can you imagine? Me at one of those things?
FR-12S0402||Kou tries to sound cheerful...
FR-12S0501|Kou|Hey. Practice over already?
FR-12S0502|Kou|But me, I'm feeling like I've sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
FR-12S0601|Daisuke|Hey, Main Character, what's his problem? Is he sick or something
FR-12S0602|Daisuke|Right?
FR-12S0603|Daisuke|I got some dirt on a bunch of other guys too, so we should have no problem getting together a full team.
FR-12S0701|Kou|Should I just leave?
FR-12S0702|Kou|Yeah, the orphanage.
FR-12S0703|Kou|I was thinking maybe I'd ask about my real parents.
FR-12S0801|Daisuke|I'm kinda worried...
FR-12S0802|Kou|What are you two doing here?
FR-12S0803|Kou|I have no one...
FR-12S0901|Kou|And now that I don't have to wear that mask anymore... I guess it's time to step off the stage.
FR-12S0902|Kou|...What do you think?
FR-12S0903|Kou|How 'bout you? Wanna go for a dip?
FR-12S1001|Kou|Studying, lessons, and all that crap... I think I'm gonna keep doing it all.
FR-12S1002|Daisuke|D-dude... We can't take this...!
FR-13S0101|P.E. Teacher|Here, why don't you say something to the team?
FR-13S0102|Kou|You played much soccer before, Main Character?
FR-13S0201|Soccor Player|Hey Main Character, tear down the goals and clean up before you leave, alright?
FR-13S0202|Daisuke|Still, it went pretty fast with three people.
FR-13S0401|Daisuke|Whatever... Girls are a pain in the ass, right, Main Character?
FR-13S0501|Kou|Kou is also beaming like it's all thanks to him...
FR-13S0601|Kou|I have to do some family stuff today, though. Would next time be okay?
FR-13S0701|Daisuke|I have to do the class record today so don't want to wait for me.
FR-13S0702|Kou|Tell you what, we'll talk over mapo rice. My treat!
FR-13S0703|Kou|You think it could be related...?
FR-13S0704|Kou|What do you think?
FR-13S0705|Kou|Kou is looking at you expectantly...
FR-13S0801||Their quarrel starts to escalate...
FR-13S0802|Daisuke|You got that!? It's MY life! You guys have nothing to do with it.
FR-13S0803|Kou|You can be pretty sincere when you want to be, Daisuke.
FR-13S0901|Daisuke|I wonder if she's as stuck in the past as I am...
FR-14S0101||He expressed his gratitude…
FR-14S0102|Naoki|Um, I apologize for saying I hated you when I first met you.
FR-14S0201|Naoki|I usually eat here a lot because it's so close to our place, but for some reason, I haven't eaten here recently.
FR-14S0202|Naoki|I mean... What exactly is an 'admirable life,' anyway?
FR-14S0301||Naoki is laughing like he's having a good time...
FR-14S0302||Naoki is biting his lip...
FR-14S0401||Naoki looks distressed...
FR-14S0402|Naoki|I'm sorry... It's a little awkward to be around me, huh?
FR-14S0501|Naoki|... ...
FR-14S0502|Naoki|... I have to do it
FR-14S0601|Naoki|They got all suspicious of me suddenly. I wasn't expecting that at all.
FR-14S0602|Naoki|Am I really that pitiable...?
FR-14S0701|Naoki|I wanted to apologize for that.
FR-14S0702|Naoki|How do I get out from that...? What would be best for me, for Sis...? I just don't know.
FR-14S0801|Naoki|Ironic isn't it...?
FR-14S0802|Naoki|Yosuke-san sure is nosy. Oh wait, so are you...
FR-14S0901|Naoki|Because I wasn't able to cry like the actors on TV. I though that maybe I didn't actually like Sis...
FR-14S0902|Naoki|She must've wanted to live more, huh?
FR-14S0903|Naoki|Naoki is biting his lip...
FR-14S1001|Naoki|It's all thanks to you.
FR-15S0101|Lady in Black|Ah… Are you the hospital janitor?
FR-15S0102|Lady in Black|This is such a nice day… if you don’t mind, wanna chat with this old woman?
FR-15S0103|Lady in Black|I've lived here all my life, but... I don't know you.
FR-15S0104|Lady in Black|My, is that so? If you're from the city, you may think it's a bit inconvenient here... But I think it's a nice town.
FR-15S0105|Hisano|I am Death.
FR-15S0201|Hisano|Haha, he was a  handsome man.
FR-15S0202|Hisano|Do I look like Death to you?
FR-15S0301|Hisano|Watching the river here with you, like this, brings back memories...
FR-15S0302|Hisano|...I was happy back then.
FR-15S0303|Hisano|He went to Heaven... and I will surely go to Hell.
FR-15S0401|Hisano|My husband's tsuki meinchi is today, and I've just come back from visiting his grave.
FR-15S0402|Hisano|For those trying to reach the gods, and to the families of those people, death can be an ally.
FR-15S0403|Hisano|You don't quite understand it yet, do you?
FR-15S0501|Hisano|It must be boring, listening to this old bag's stories...
FR-15S0502|Hisano|Enough about me. I want to hear something from you. Tell me anything.
FR-15S0503|Hisano|But... I do not want to see you anymore.
FR-15S0601|Hisano|Being noncommittal... floating around, never deciding to be one thing nor another. Can a man understand that?
FR-15S0602|Hisano|But I wanted to write my reply so badly, so I would grow impatient and read it carefully, over and over.
FR-15S0701||What should you do?
FR-15S0702|Hisano|I'm sure he never imagined that the 'Hisa-san' he loved would some day wish to see him dead...
FR-15S0703|Hisano|That was his punishment. Punishment for forgetting me...
FR-15S0801|Hisano|I must accept that...
FR-15S0901|Hisano|I didn't want to accept that he had died all by himself, not remembering me, leaving me behind...
FR-15S0902|Hisano|Haha... But it's too late now, isn't it?
FR-15S1001|Hisano|At first, I turned them down because I didn't want to leave the place I was born in, but...
FR-15S1002|Hisano|I'd feel that... our story hasn't truly ended...
FR-15S1003|Hisano|...Do you have someone you love?
FR-16S0101|Yuuta’s Mother|I've been sitting here all this time...
FR-16S0102|Yuuta’s Mother|My husband is away, so... Heh... It's just the two of us, alone together in a dark house.
FR-16S0201|Eri|...Do you like children?
FR-16S0202|Eri|I don't hate him, but...
FR-16S0301|Eri|I guess he wants to see his father.
FR-16S0302|Eri|*sigh* He's so inconsiderate...
FR-16S0401|Eri|I should have known better tha to try. We're not related, so there's nothing I can do about it...
FR-16S0402|Eri|Doesn't that make you feel better? Isn't that a wonderful idea?
FR-16S0403|Eri|Honestly, though... I just want to go back to the city.
FR-16S0404|Eri|Please, don't tell Yuu-kin... Or the other mothers.
FR-16S0501|Yuuta|...Is she mad at me
FR-16S0502|Yuuta|... ...
FR-16S0601|Yuuta|...I've never seen Poenix Ranger Featherman R.
FR-16S0602|Yuuta|...She's always watching TV.
FR-16S0603|Eri|*huff* *huff* I'm sorry I'm late...
FR-16S0604|Eri|I don't know what a child wants...
FR-16S0701|Yuuta|You told her I liked Phoenix Ranger Featherman R, huh?
FR-16S0702|Yuuta|I-In return for her gift!?
FR-16S0703|Eri|I wonder if he's afraid of me.
FR-16S0704|Eri|He must hate the fact I'm here.
FR-16S0801|Ms. Nakamura|Oh, who is this? He seems a bit young to be your husband.
FR-16S0802|Eri|If only... If only he was a more studious child...
FR-16S0901|Eri|I'm sorry about the other day. Were you hurt?
FR-16S0902|Yuuta|...Sor...ry...
FR-16S0903|Eri|He's actually a sweet boy...
FR-16S0904|Eri|...What took me so long, huh?
FR-16S1001|Eri|So, today's the last day he'll be here. When Yuuta's done with school, we'll spend time together at the house.
FR-17S0101|Sayoko|Don't worry, no one'll see...
FR-17S0201|Sayoko|Would you like to study with me? Perhaps a subject that they don't teach in school, if you catch my drift...?
FR-17S0301|Sayoko|...So why are you working at a job like this?
FR-17S0302|Sayoko|Speaking of which... Say, do you have a girlfriend?
FR-17S0303|Sayoko|...Do you see what I'm getting at?
FR-17S0401|Old Lady In Black|Do you work here?
FR-17S0402|Old Lady In Black|But I won't be coming back here anymore...
FR-17S0403|Sayoko|...Don't ask what happened here.
FR-17S0404|Sayoko|They only need me when they're my patients... in the end, they all leave me.
FR-17S0501|Sayoko|That was the first time anyone ever called me a 'Slutty bitch' to my face...
FR-17S0502|Sayoko|*sigh* The other nurses were just watching with these stupid smirks on their faces.
FR-17S0503|Sayoko|What am I living for...?
FR-17S0601||Sayoko isn't saying anything...
FR-17S0602|Sayoko|What am I doing...?
FR-17S0603||Sayoko seems to be tormenting herself.
FR-17S0701||Sayoko looks a bit pale. She also seems to be very tired.
FR-17S0901|Middle-aged Nurse|We're going to be needing this room, so can you get all your cleaning supplies out of here?
FR-17S0902|Sayoko|I was just a little wobbly...
FR-17S0903||What should you do...?
FR-17S0904|Sayoko|Otherwise... I'd never be able to face him again...
FR-17S1001|Sayoko|I wanted to say goodbye.
FR-18S0101|Shu|If I think you're inadequate, I'll have you replaced immediately. Remember that.
FR-18S0102||You feel confident that you should teach him:
FR-18S0201|Shu|...If I get into a good college... Am I really 'set'?
FR-18S0202|Shu|...Do you know what that means?
FR-18S0203|Shu|Huh... Time's up. We were still in the middle of that last question...
FR-18S0301|Shu|What do you think of your school?
FR-18S0302|Shu|... ...
FR-18S0401|Shu|...They don't get what it means to learn at all.
FR-18S0402|Shu|That place...
FR-18S0501|Shu|Is there any bullying at your school?
FR-18S0502|Shu|Maybe that's not the same thing as bullying.
FR-18S0503|Shu|It seems that I've been talking to you about things that really aren't relevant to my studies...
FR-18S0601|Shu|*Sigh*
FR-18S0602|Shu|...They're all stupid.
FR-18S0603|Shu|Um... You only come here because you're being paid to, right?
FR-18S0701|Shu|...I wish I was a genius.
FR-18S0702|Shu|Let's change the subject to something else. What's up?
FR-18S0801|Shu|Is it possible for anyone to be all those things? Do you know anyone like that?
FR-18S0802|Shu|...Every time I have that dream, the person gets one car closer to me.
FR-18S0803||Shu suddenly looks tormented...
FR-18S0901|Shu|Today... is my birthday, I forgot...
FR-18S0902||Shu looks sad...
FR-18S0903||First, you need...
FR-18S0904||Well... it looks like the only place you can order it.
FR-18S0905||Shu begins to sob...
FR-18S0906||Shu begins to cry again.
FR-18S1001|Shu|Thank you for recognizing... 'me.' I wouldn't have been able to talk to Mom if you hadn't.
FR-20S0101|Ai|Just knowing everyone else is still stuck at school studying makes it feel great to be out here.
FR-20S0102|Ai|This time… everyone else must be still studying? That’s the best.
FR-20S0103||Ai only seems to be concerned about her own shopping...
FR-20S0104||Ai paid for everything with a gold card...
FR-20S0201|Ai|Hmm, doesn't look like they've gotten anything new in. I already have all of this...
FR-20S0202|Ai|Buy me an ice latte.
FR-20S0203|Ai|They should get rid of all salespeople and put in vending machines. Press a button, and out comes your clothes.
FR-20S0301|Ai|What should we do instead?
FR-20S0302|Ai|Looking at it from your perspective, I'd say you got pretty lucky.
FR-20S0303||Ai rejected him without a second thought...
FR-20S0401||The conversation is getting more and more vulgar...
FR-20S0402|Ai|... ...
FR-20S0501|Ai|Th-thank you for that, last time...
FR-20S0502|Ai|Do you think maybe I'm his type? O-or do you think he hates me...
FR-20S0503|Ai|All I need you to do is... ask him what's his type. That's it.
FR-20S0601|Ai|But if I can't be loved, then what's the point!?
FR-20S0602|Ai|It's not like I have any other redeeming qualities...
FR-20S0603|Ai|Haha, just kidding.
FR-20S0604|Ai|Hmm... do you think we can be a good match?
LV-20S0701|Ai|I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep making you hang out with me...
LV-20S0702|Ai|I wonder why...?
LV-20S0801|Ai|He was just... a normal, good guy. I guess what I felt was a kind of a fleeting thing.
LV-20S0901||Things don't look good... You feel Ai is in danger.
LV-20S0902|Ai|Uh... Sorry, was that unnecessary?
LV-20S1001||What will you do?
FR-20S0701|Ai|Hey, why don’t you pick out some clothes for me? What do you think I’d look good in?
FR-20S0702|Ai|Isn’t that right, Main Character?
FR-20S0703|Ai|… Do you think I’m pretty?
FR-20S0801|Ai|Main Character… Do you love me?
FR-20S0802|Ai|You need me, right?
FR-20S0901|Ai|I think we need to… break up.
FR-20S0902|Ai|I’m so worthless…
FR-20S0903|Ai|I’m sure you’ll eventually hate me… and then you’ll leave me.
FR-20S0904|Ai|Is there any way… that we could just be friends?
FR-20S1001|Ai|Still… I’m not good at being alone. I know it’s a lot to ask, but… will you stay by my side?
FR-21S0101|Yumi|Push the air out... Now, say 'Ahh'!
FR-21S0102|Yumi|I'll see you next time. Come to practice, okay?
FR-21S0201||The line began...
FR-21S0202||Then it went...
FR-21S0203|Yumi|...But I do want us to take it seriously, so give it a shot okay?
FR-21S0301|Yumi|Huh...? Oh, er... what should I do? We're still...
FR-21S0302|Yumi|Wh-when did you get here!? Were you listening to me?
FR-21S0303||Yumi is trembling with anger...
FR-21S0401|Yumi|...Was I wrong when I said that?
FR-21S0402|Yumi|...Anywhere but at home.
FR-21S0403|Yumi|Just forget about this, okay?
FR-21S0501|Yumi|Main Character-kun... Why are you...?
FR-21S0502|Yumi|She's pushing herself too far. She's so stupid.
FR-21S0503|Yumi|It's all because of my parents. They're both holding me back.
FR-21S0504|Yumi|It's not like you have anything to do with what's happening in my life.
FR-21S0601|Yumi|...I just came from Dad's-- that man's room...
FR-21S0602|Yumi|...Why do I have to go through all of this? Why me!?
FR-21S0701|Yumi|...He's so stupid.
FR-21S0801|Yumi|There's... just somethings I just don't understand.
FR-21S0901||Yumi is not doing good.
FR-21S0902||Yumi seems to be enduring the tragedy.
FR-21S0903|Yumi|I am good at something... But what kind of thing?
FR-21S1001|Yumi|I'll turn around, so if you're going to reject me, just leave the room. That way, I won't have to see you go...
LV-21S1002|Yumi|Picturing it... It's kind of embarrassing, huh?
FR-22S0101|Band Captain|So, Main Character, have any experience with musical instruments?
FR-22S0102|Ayane|Do you have any questions, Senpai?
FR-22S0103||Cleanup looks like a big task for just one person...
FR-22S0201|Ayane|I wish I had as much talent as you.
FR-22S0202||Cleanup looks like a big task for just one person...
FR-22S0301|Ayane|I think I'll stick around and practice. I was out so long, I didn't even touch my trombone.
FR-22S0302|Ayane|...Not that I'll be in it, but still...
FR-22S0303|Ayane|Because there are lots of other things I  can do for the club. Scheduling, accounting, cleaning up...
FR-22S0401|Ayane|Shoot... I still can't play the part I was messing up last time.
FR-22S0402|Ayane|It'd be nice to be able to play outside, but I'd embarrass myself if I went alone...
FR-22S0403|Ayane|Oh... I'm distracting you from your own practive, aren't I...
FR-22S0501||As the others leave, Ayane stays engrossed in her practice...
FR-22S0502|Ayane|I can't... I can't do it...
FR-22S0701||The other members are remaining silent...
FR-22S0702||Ayane is weeping...
FR-22S0801||What should you do...?
LV-22S0901||Ayane looks at the ground nervously
DN-02D01|Yosuke|What kinda person could be doing this?
DN-05D01||What kind of omelette should you make?
PH-20110529D01|Daisuke|Here, Main Character, you can have it.
PH-20110717D01|Kou|...You any good at math, Main Character?
PH-20110810D01|Kou|Tadaaa! ‘The O-Cha Way’… Want it?
ST-20110412D01|Mr. Morooka|Tell 'em your name, kid, and make it quick.
ST-20110414D01|Chie|Haa... So… uh... We're still alive… right?
ST-20110415D01|Yosuke|What about you? Could you just walk away?
ST-20110515D01|Yosuke|So… what do you think about Yukiko and Chie? I mean, let's not mince words: Which one's your type?
ST-20110608D01|Female Student|Oh, we should have Sensei call him back. Do you remember his name?
ST-20110608D02|Female Student|Oh, about the gauze, huh? What did he say?
ST-20110617D01||You're being looked at with expectation…
ST-20110617D02|Yosuke|Dude's seriously going for it... Hey man, you gotta stop him.
ST-20110622D01|Yosuke|Anyways, now that all those people are gone, we might as well check inside. I'll buy something.
ST-20110710D01|Rise|I do owe you my life, so... you know...
ST-20110710D02||Nanako seems scared…
ST-20110723D01|Rise|How did you do, Senpai?
ST-20110723D02|Nanako|They still haven't caught him?
ST-20110820D01|Nanako|It's kinda hard to walk.
ST-20110820D02|Rise|How do we look, Senpai? Does the sight make your heart skip a beat?
ST-20110909D01||What will your orders be…?
ST-20110910D01|Chie|Hey, let's buy a souvenir at the station.
ST-20110910D02|Nanako|Did you have fun?
ST-20111027D01|Yosuke|What about you? You want them to be in it, right?
ST-20111203D01|Yosuke|What do you want to do… Leader?
ST-20111203D02|Yosuke|What're you trying to say!?
ST-20111203D03|Yosuke|Something we don't know…? What don't we know!?
ST-20111203D04|Yosuke|What didn't you understand!?
ST-20111203D05|Yosuke|Are you even getting at something here, or are you just stalling!?
ST-20111203D06|Yosuke|Are we doing this or not!? That's all I give a damn about right now!
ST-20111205D01||The true culprit is…
ST-20111205D02||The true culprit is…
ST-20111205D03||The true culprit is…
ST-20111205D04||The true culprit is…
ST-20111205D05||The true culprit is…
ST-20111205D06||The true culprit is…
ST-20111205D07||The true culprit is…
