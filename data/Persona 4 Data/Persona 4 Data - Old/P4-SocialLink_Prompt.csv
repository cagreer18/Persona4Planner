SLP12S04R02Pf|Kou tries to sound cheerful...|Friend
SLP12S05R01Pf|Kou: "Hey. Practice over already?"|Friend
SLP12S05R02Pf|Kou: "But me, I'm feeling like I've sunk to the bottom of the ocean."|Friend
SLP12S06R01Pf|Daisuke: "Hey, Main Character, what's his problem? Is he sick or something"|Friend
SLP12S06R02Pf|Daisuke: "Right?"|Friend
SLP12S06R03Pf|Daisuke: "I got some dirt on a bunch of other guys too, so we should have no problem getting together a full team."|Friend
SLP12S07R01Pf|Kou: "Should I just leave?"|Friend
SLP12S07R02Pf|Kou: "Yeah, the orphanage."|Friend

SLP14S07R01Pf|Naoki: "I wanted to apologize for that."|Friend
SLP14S07R02Pf|Naoki: "How do I get out from that...? What would be best for me, for Sis...? I just don't know."|Friend
SLP14S08R01Pf|Naoki: "Ironic isn't it...?"|Friend
SLP14S08R02Pf|Naoki: "Yosuke-san sure is nosy. Oh wait, so are you..."|Friend
SLP14S09R01Pf|Naoki: "Because I wasn't able to cry like the actors on TV. I though that maybe I didn't actually like Sis..."|Friend
SLP14S09R02Pf|Naoki: "She must've wanted to live more, huh?"|Friend
SLP14S09R03Pf|Naoki is biting his lip...|Friend

SLP15S05R03Pf|Hisano: "But... I do not want to see you anymore."|Friend
SLP15S06R01Pf|Hisano: "Being noncommittal... floating around, never deciding to be one thing nor another. Can a man understand that?"|Friend
SLP15S06R02Pf|Hisano: "But I wanted to write my reply so badly, so I would grow impatient and read it carefully, over and over."|Friend
SLP15S07R01Pf|What should you do?|Friend
SLP15S07R02Pf|Hisano: "I'm sure he never imagined that the 'Hisa-san' he loved would some day wish to see him dead..."|Friend
SLP15S07R03Pf|Hisano: "That was his punishment. Punishment for forgetting me..."|Friend
SLP15S08R01Pf|Hisano: "I must accept that..."|Friend
SLP15S09R01Pf|Hisano: "I didn't want to accept that he had died all by himself, not remembering me, leaving me behind..."|Friend
SLP15S09R02Pf|Hisano: "Haha... But it's too late now, isn't it?"|Friend
SLP15S10R01Pf|Hisano: "At first, I turned them down because I didn't want to leave the place I was born in, but..."|Friend
SLP15S10R02Pf|Hisano: "I'd feel that... our story hasn't truly ended..."|Friend

SLP16S03R02Pf|Eri: "*sigh* He's so inconsiderate..."|Friend
SLP16S04R01Pf|Eri: "I should have known better tha to try. We're not related, so there's nothing I can do about it..."|Friend
SLP16S04R02Pf|Eri: "Doesn't that make you feel better? Isn't that a wonderful idea?"|Friend
SLP16S04R03Pf|Eri: "Honestly, though... I just want to go back to the city."|Friend
SLP16S04R04Pf|Eri: "Please, don't tell Yuu-kin... Or the other mothers."|Friend

SLP16S07R02Pf|Yuuta: "I-In return for her gift!?"|Friend
SLP16S07R03Pf|Eri: "I wonder if he's afraid of me."|Friend
SLP16S07R04Pf|Eri: "He must hate the fact I'm here."|Friend
SLP16S08R01Pf|Ms. Nakamura: "Oh, who is this? He seems a bit young to be your husband."|Friend
SLP16S08R02Pf|Eri: "If only... If only he was a more studious child..."|Friend
SLP16S09R01Pf|Eri: "I'm sorry about the other day. Were you hurt?"|Friend
SLP16S09R02Pf|Yuuta: "...Sor...ry...|Friend
SLP16S09R03Pf|Eri: "He's actually a sweet boy..."|Friend
SLP16S09R04Pf|Eri: "...What took me so long, huh?"|Friend
SLP16S10R01Pf|Eri: "So, today's the last day he'll be here. When Yuuta's done with school, we'll spend time together at the house."|Friend
SLP17S01R01Pf|Sayoko: "Don't worry, no one'll see..."|Friend
SLP17S02R01Pf|Sayoko: "Would you like to study with me? Perhaps a subject that they don't teach in school, if you catch my drift...?"|Friend
SLP17S03R01Pf|Sayoko: "...So why are you working at a job like this?"|Friend
SLP17S03R02Pf|Sayoko: "Speaking of which... Say, do you have a girlfriend?"|Friend
SLP17S03R03Pf|Sayoko: "...Do you see what I'm getting at?"|Friend
SLP17S04R01Pf|Old lady in black: "Do you work here?"|Friend
SLP17S04R02Pf|Old lady in black: "But I won't be coming back here anymore..."|Friend
SLP17S04R03Pf|Sayoko: "...Don't ask what happened here."|Friend
SLP17S04R04Pf|Sayoko: "They only need me when they're my patients... in the end, they all leave me."|Friend
SLP17S05R01Pf|Sayoko: "That was the first time anyone ever called me a 'Slutty bitch' to my face..."|Friend
SLP17S05R02Pf|Sayoko: "*sigh* The other nurses were just watching with these stupid smirks on their faces."|Friend
SLP17S05R03Pf|Sayoko: "What am I living for...?"|Friend
SLP17S06R01Pf|Sayoko isn't saying anything...|Friend
SLP17S06R02Pf|Sayoko: "What am I doing...?"|Friend

SLP18S01R02Pf|You feel confident that you should teach him:|Friend
SLP18S02R01Pf|Shu: "...If I get into a good college... Am I really 'set'?"|Friend
SLP18S02R02Pf|Shu: "...Do you know what that means?"|Friend
SLP18S02R03Pf|Shu: "Huh... Time's up. We were still in the middle of that last question..."|Friend
SLP18S03R01Pf|Shu: "What do you think of your school?"|Friend
SLP18S03R02Pf|Shu: "... ..."|Friend
SLP18S04R01Pf|Shu: "...They don't get what it means to learn at all."|Friend
SLP18S04R02Pf|Shu: "That place..."|Friend
SLP18S05R01Pf|Shu:: "Is there any bullying at your school?"|Friend
SLP18S05R02Pf|Shu: "Maybe that's not the same thing as bullying."|Friend
SLP18S05R03Pf|Shu: "It seems that I've been talking to you about things that really aren't relevant to my studies..."|Friend
SLP18S06R01Pf|Shu: "*Sigh*"|Friend
SLP18S06R02Pf|Shu: "...They're all stupid."|Friend
SLP18S06R03Pf|Shu: "Um... You only come here because you're being paid to, right?"|Friend
SLP18S07R01Pf|Shu: "...I wish I was a genius."|Friend
SLP18S07R02Pf|Shu: "Let's change the subject to something else. What's up?"|Friend

SLP20S02R02Pf|Ai: "Buy me an ice latte."|Friend
SLP20S02R03Pf|Ai: "They should get rid of all salespeople and put in vending machines. Press a button, and out comes your clothes."|Friend
SLP20S03R01Pf|Ai: "What should we do instead?"|Friend
SLP20S03R02Pf|Ai: "Looking at it from your perspective, I'd say you got pretty lucky."|Friend

SLP20S05R02Pf|Ai: "Do you think maybe I'm his type? O-or do you think he hates me..."|Friend
SLP20S05R03Pf|Ai: "All I need you to do is... ask him what's his type. That's it.|Friend
SLP20S06R01Pf|Ai: "But if I can't be loved, then what's the point!?"|Friend
SLP20S06R02Pf|Ai: "It's not like I have any other redeeming qualities..."|Friend

SLP20S09R01Pf|Things don't look good... You feel Ai is in danger.|Friend
SLP20S09R02Pf|Ai: "Uh... Sorry, was that unnecessary?"|Friend

SLP21S10R01Pf|Yumi: "I'll turn around, so if you're going to reject me, just leave the room. That way, I won't have to see you go..."|Friend

SLP22S03R02Pf|Ayane: "...Not that I'll be in it, but still..."|Friend
SLP22S03R03Pf|Ayane: "Because there are lots of other things I  can do for the club. Scheduling, accounting, cleaning up..."|Friend
SLP22S04R01Pf|Ayane: "Shoot... I still can't play the part I was messing up last time."|Friend
SLP22S04R02Pf|Ayane: "It'd be nice to be able to play outside, but I'd embarrass myself if I went alone..."|Friend
SLP22S04R03Pf|Ayane: "Oh... I'm distracting you from your own practive, aren't I..."|Friend
SLP22S05R01Pf|As the others leave, Ayane stays engrossed in her practice..."|Friend
